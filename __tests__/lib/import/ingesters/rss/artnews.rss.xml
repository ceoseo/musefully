      <description><![CDATA[Noland incorporates walkers, wheelchairs, and canes into her portraits of American tragedy. It's unsettling.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[










<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Cady Noland’s work has never sat quite right with me. Sure, there are the familiar critiques—that her portraits of America, made of Budweiser cans and bullets, don’t feel like <em>her</em> America, since she is wealthy and white. One is that the elusive artist, known for walking away from the art world at the height of fame, felt like an even greater class traitor when she chose Gagosian’s Upper East Side location for a rare show, her second in New York in as many decades. Another is that she mounted the show without seeming to troll blue-chip dealers, the way David Hammons famously tends to. What unsettles me is the way that she incorporates walkers, wheelchairs, and canes into her portraits of American tragedy.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Don’t get me wrong: I loved her 2018 retrospective in Germany so much that I traveled to see it twice—and it was at the MMK in Frankfurt, arguably Europe’s most boring city. But one subway ride to Manhattan for the Gagosian show, which closes October 21, left me feeling unsatisfied.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	This show is mostly new work, and as ever, Noland’s red, white, and blue sculptures made of resin and refuse chafe at the contradictions between the American dream and the American reality. There is, though, an untitled walker from 1986, wrapped in a leather strap and bearing a badge that says “special police.” It’s on view alongside sculptures that, pairing bullets and badges, invoke police brutality. Badges abound, but the walker’s is the only one inscribed with the word “special,” that grating euphemism for “disabled.” I can’t tell if the choice was intentional and insensitive, or just blithe and inconsiderate. But for decades, she’s shown assistive devices alongside grenades and can collections, as if she were equating disability with fates as tragic as destitution or death.</p>

<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Part of me was pleased to see mass disablement included as one of the machinations of American neoliberalism for once. Inaccessible healthcare, unaffordable nutritious foods, gun violence, and an environment rife with disabling toxins are eroding American health (and, as the theorist Lauren Berlant argued, preventing our uprisings).</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	But another part of me saw Noland’s walker stumbling clumsily into a paradox, one that disability theorist Jasbir K. Puar articulated in her 2017 book <em>The Right to Maim: Debility, Capacity, Disability</em>.Puar describes mass disablement and injury as deliberate tactics of policing, writing specifically about the Israeli Defense Force. Then she asks: how do we hold space for rage at this reality alongside our longing for disability pride?</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	But with Noland, instead of pride, all we get is pity.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Is that pity the artist’s or America’s? As ever, she’s just tracing the impact of the unseen forces of American neoliberalism on ordinary objects, without ever offering clear commentary. But still, she gestures at a bigger, bleaker truth: that the neoliberal state benefits from discourses of empowerment, which conveniently place responsibility on the individual rather than the government. (Remember that our hard-won, landmark legislation—the 1990’s Americans with Disabilities Act—was signed into law by George H. W. Bush, who saw granting rights as a tool for getting more disabled people off welfare.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1250" height="937" src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Job_4664.jpg?w=1250" alt="Aluminum objects and a coke can sit in a metal milk crate.

<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	But I also wonder to what degree Noland included assistive devices simply because they look like her sculptures already. The walker is shown next to Polaroids of older works rife with grab bars and scaffolding that echo the walker’s aluminum tubing. &nbsp;</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	These new works, all crammed into a small space, feel formulaic, as if the artist were cleaning out stuff that’d been kicking around in her studio for decades. (After all, she uses Budweiser cans that, as my colleague <a  href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/reviews/cady-noland-gagosian-review-1234679498/">Alex Greenberger points out</a>, are no longer in circulation). But the weirdest, and maybe the best, update is that some of the resin blocks now sit on lucite tables, as if the art objects were extensions of fancy furniture. Was that choice about meaning or materials? Here, since it’d be a contradiction to offer class commentary in the form of a luxury good for sale at Gagosian anyway, I like the ambiguity.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[A collaboration with the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the recently opened exhibition is on view until next February. ]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[










<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	This year marks the 170th anniversary of Vincent van Gogh’s birth, but it is his final months that are now the subject of a major exhibition at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris. Organized in collaboration with the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, where the exhibition debuted earlier this year, “Van Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise. The Final Months” (through February 4, 2024) brings together 48 of the 74 paintings and 25 of the 33 drawings, many of which are being shown in Paris for the first time, that the Post-Impressionist made between May 20, 1890, when he moved to Auvers-sur-Oise, and his death on July 29.</p>







<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Van Gogh moved to Auvers-sur-Oise, a pastoral commune about 20 miles northwest of Paris, to be closer to his brother and art dealer Theo and his infant nephew, Vincent Willem, as well as to receive treatment from Dr. Paul Gachet. </p>

<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The first gallery in the Orsay exhibition focuses on Gachet, who made a career out of treating melancholy, the focus of his thesis, and counted artists like Paul Cezanne, Armand Guillaumin, and Camille Pissarro as his patients. Gachet considered van Gogh both a patient and a friend, inviting the artist over for lunch on Sundays. Among the works on view are van Gogh’s portraits of Gachet, including the famed 1890 painting donated to the Musée d’Orsay in 1949, as well as the only etching that van Gogh ever made; Gachet had provided the artist with the materials to create it.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Divided into six thematic sections, like “‘Auvers is seriously beautiful&#8230;’” and “The modern portraiture,” the exhibition includes village scenes, still lifes of flowers, experimental portraits with weave patterns, tone-on-tone paintings, a series of fascinating double-sided sketches, letters from Van Gogh including one that he never sent, and 11 of the 12 double square landscapes (1 meter by 50 centimeters, around 3 feet 3 inches by 1 foot 8 inches) that were among van Gogh’s final obsessions before his death.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="571" src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/22.-Champ-de-ble-aux-corbeaux-1.jpg" alt="A painting, with visible brushstrokes, showing a wheat field with crows flying into a deep blue sky.

<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	It is an exceptional display. “This room is an unicum,” said Emmanuel Coquery, the director of the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the exhibition’s co-curator. “The public won’t see anything like it, before a very long time.” (Coquery said he did not request the 12th double-square landscapes, titled <em>Daubigny’s Garden</em> from the Hiroshima Museum of Art in Japan “for logical and ecological reasons”; its twin, however, is on loan from the Kunstmuseum Basel in Switzerland.)  </p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Among the most famous works on view is <em>Wheatfield with crows </em>(1890), which has not left Amsterdam in nearly a century. The dynamic composition, with confident, visible brushstrokes, features ominous crows fluttering around a stormy sky, often interpreted as the artist’s awareness that his end was near.The painting has long been seen as Van Gogh’s ultimate work, but I much preferred <em>Tree Roots </em>(1890)<em>,</em> which is believed to have been completed a few hours before the Dutch master shot himself in the chest. The seemingly abstract painting, with a hurried, almost unfinished appearance, shows a colorful entanglement of roots and tree trunks—the vision of all-mighty nature.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="593" src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/26.-Racines.jpg" alt="A painting that shows various tree roots that because of its perspective and brushstrokes appears slightly abstract.

<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Van Gogh’s death, which has been subject to much speculation, is not extensively addressed in the exhibition, only in the catalogue. “We thought about it, but had no intention of adding fuel to controversies,” Coquery said. “We opted for the road of silence.” In an essay titled “A Short Biography of Unbearable Suffering: Van Gogh’s Self-Chosen End,” Louis van Tilborgh rejects the recent theory that van Gogh did not die by suicide but was murdered, writing, “A greater understanding of what motivated his tragic act can only be achieved when the process leading up to it is mapped out. … Without such analysis, interpreting Van Gogh’s work and life in his months remains somewhat arbitrary, and would amount to nothing less than a biographical misstep.”</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Coquery added, “When a person feels compelled to end their own life, the least they deserve is to be heard with empathy.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="965" src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/10.-Bords-lOise-a-Auvers.jpg" alt="A painting showing three people at a row of boats on a lake with trees in the background.

<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Van Gogh’s relationship with Gachet is further drawn out in the exhibition via the inclusion of the palette, now owned by the Orsay, that Gachet lent van Gogh (on June 27), so that he could finish the portrait of his daughter Marguerite playing the piano in a white dress against a red-spotted green background. As part of its efforts to include digitally focused programming for its exhibitions, the d’Orsay has also commissioned a 10-minute VR experience by Agnès Molia et Gordon that allows visitors to explore the contours and hues of this history-infused object.</p>

<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“We did not want to alter Van Gogh’s works, whose proportions have been respected in the program, and we chose to work on his palette instead,” Agnès Abastado, head of the digital department at the Musée d’Orsay, said of the decision to not create an immersive experience of van Gogh’s paintings like those that have been popular over the past few years. Upon entering a re-creation of Gachet’s interior, Marguerite’s voice lulls you into having a look around, until a color-heavy piece of wood starts levitating toward you. “The perspective then changes,” said Coquery. “The palette becomes a landscape and the user a Lilliputian confronted to hill-sized impastos.”</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Like the paint-covered palette, van Gogh’s final paintings are filled with brilliant colors. In <em>Jardin à Auvers-sur-Oise </em>(1890), showing a green-dominated view of Charles-François Daubigny’s garden, van Gogh combines various techniques—flurries of dots, loose or tightly packed strokes, aligned or swirling, neater contours—in such a way that the painting still thrums with life.&nbsp;Coquery said, “Van Gogh is always associated with color. We wanted to highlight the materiality, the thickness of his works.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[










<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The Parthenon Marbles were once vibrantly colored with intricate patterns, according to a new study <a  rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/goddess-new-clothes-the-carving-and-polychromy-of-the-parthenon-sculptures/9D7277925E339AC98642081CBAAD8794" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/goddess-new-clothes-the-carving-and-polychromy-of-the-parthenon-sculptures/9D7277925E339AC98642081CBAAD8794" target="_blank">published</a> in the journal <em>Antiquity</em> on Wednesday. </p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Originally intended to decorate the steps of the Athenian Parthenon Temple, the Parthenon Marbles were crafted more than 2,500 years ago by the ancient Greeks. Their fragments are now held by the British Museum in London, whose possession of them has ignited <a  rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/parthenon-marbles-british-museum-restitution-1234605904/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/parthenon-marbles-british-museum-restitution-1234605904/" target="_blank">a contentious and ongoing restitution debate</a>.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Though it might not be immediately visible along the surface, the deities and mythical creatures depicted in the statues were once painted in bright Egyptian blue, white, and purple hues. The colors represented the figures&#8217; origins: the water from which they rose, the snakeskin of a sea serpent, background spaces between figures, and figurative patterns on the gods&#8217; robes.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	For centuries, it was assumed that Greek and Roman sculptures were muted in color or didn&#8217;t have any color at all. This common misconception came from years of viewing pristine stone and clay that had experienced decay and had been scrubbed clean. The same is true of the Parthenon Marbles, which weren&#8217;t prepared in a way that would allow their paint to properly adhere to the stones&#8217; surfaces. As a result, previous historical restorations actually went so far as to remove traces of paint found on the figures.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Using luminescent imaging, archaeologists were able to find hidden chemical elements from traces of paint on the sculptures&#8217; surfaces. The team found evidence of hidden patterns, such as floral designs and figurative depictions, that were created using a mix of four pigments.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The blue was made by the Egyptians and used often by ancient Greeks and Romans, the purple tint was produced using previously unknown ingredients, and the two whites were crafted from the mineral gypsum and a bone white pigment made from bone ash.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The color was &#8220;as visually important as the carving,&#8221; the researchers wrote in the study. Based on the paint, the Parthenon may have been much more brightly colored than was previously thought.</p>
