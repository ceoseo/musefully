### Additional Metadata

It's often necessary to augment backend collection data with additional metadata. For example, theme tags like "Climate Justice" might be associated with artworks in a CMS rather the backend collections management system. The "sortPriority" field allows one to prominently display specific documents by adjusting the ordering in default searches. This additional metadata is stored in `data/BrooklynMuseum/additionalMetadata.jsonl`, but could just as easily be exported from a CMS.

### Getty Union List of Artist Names (ULAN) Data

ULAN XML was downloaded from [Getty's website](http://ulandownloads.getty.edu/) and converted to JSON using the `ulanXmlToJsonConvert.ts` script. When updating the `terms` index, the script attempts to find a matching artist name from this JSON file. If found, the ULAN artist data is added to the terms index document.

## Elasticsearch Indices

### Elasticsearch DSL

This project uses Elasticsearch [Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html) with the Elasticsearch [Javascript Client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/index.html) to manage indices and query data.

### Elasticsearch Field Types

Basic Elasticsearch index, field types, analyzers, and filters are defined in `util/elasticsearch/settings.ts`.

### Index Definition

Adjust number_of_shards and number_of_replicas for your use case.

#### Analyzers & Filters

[Mapping Character Filters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-mapping-charfilter.html):

- `hyphenApostropheMappingFilter` - replaces hyphens with spaces and removes single quotes.
- `articleCharFilter` - UNUSED - replaces common articles (de, van, der, etc.) with spaces. Originally intended to help with searching names containing many articles.

[Filters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-tokenfilters.html):

- `enSnowball` - stems words using a [Snowball-generated stemmer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-snowball-tokenfilter.html) for English language

[Analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analyzer.html):

- `unaggregatedStandardAnalyzer` - For common text fields that are not aggregated.
- `aggregatedKeywordAnalyzer` - For aggregated keyword fields
- `suggestAnalyzer` - For search_as_you_type fields

#### Field definitions

Most definitions are straight-forward. Some search and suggest fields contain subfields "search" and "suggest" used for those use-cases.

### Elasticsearch Indices

Indices are defined in `/util/elasticsearch/indices.ts`.

### Re-used Object Fields

Some object fields are re-used across multiple indices.

Constituent:

- `id` - Source-dependent ID of the constituent
- `name` - Name of the constituent, e.g. "Pablo Picasso"
- `dates` - A free-form string representing the dates of a constituent, often the birth & death of an artist, e.g. "ca. 1483–1556"
- `birthYear` - Birth year of the constituent
- `deathYear` - Death year of the constituent
- `nationality` - Array of nationalities of the constituent

Museum Location:

- `id` - Source-dependent ID of the location
- `name` - Name of the location, e.g. ""
- `isPublic` - Whether the location is public
- `isFloor` - Whether the location is a floor
- `parentId` - The ID of the parent location

#### Base Document

The base document defines common fields for all indices, these are the fields used for cross-index search. The Elasticsearch Base Document fields are defined in `indices.ts` and the associated Typescript interface is defined in `/types/document.ts`.

- `type` - The type of document, e.g. "object", "terms"
- `source` - The source of the document, e.g. "Brooklyn Museum", "Getty ULAN"
- `url` - The URL of the document
- `id` - The unique ID of the document
- `title` - The title of the document
- `description` - The description of the document
- `searchText` - The text used for full-text search. This can be configured on a per-index basis to allow global search to include special fields like accession number.
- `keywords` - An array of keywords for the document
- `boostedKeywords` - An array of keywords that should be boosted in search results
- `primaryConstituent` - The primary constituent of the document, e.g. the artist of a painting.
- `image` - Image. The main image of the document
- `date` - For RSS feeds, the date of the entry. For events, the start date of the event. Not used for artworks. TODO: Refactor to `startDate` or something clearer.
- `formattedDate` - A string representing the date, no strict format.
- `startYear` - An integer representing the start date year. Used for year range filtering.
- `endYear` - An integer representing the end date year. Used for year range filtering.
- `sortPriority` - Integer representing the priority or weight of a document. Allows for default search results customization.

Note on dates: Museum objects have a wide range of dates from pre-historic BCE to contemporary CE that ISO 8601 cannot represent, hence the use of signed integers to represent years.

- `preferred`: The preferred term, e.g. "Pablo Picasso"
- `alternates`: An array of alternate terms, e.g. ["Picasso, Pablo", "Picasso", etc.]
- `summary`: A summary of the term. Deprecated, use data fields instead.
- `description`: A description of the term. Deprecated, use data fields instead.
- `data`: The raw data of the term, e.g. the JSON from the Getty ULAN.

### Elasticsearch Queries

##### Multi-match Search

Text queries are currently searched with multi_match default [`best_fields`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html). Fields can be weighted to give priority, in this case `boostedKeywords` is very heavily weighted for cases where you want a document to appear first if it contains an important keyword.

```
multi_match: {
    query: q,
    type: 'cross_fields',
    operator: 'and',
    fields: [
        'boostedKeywords^20',
        'primaryConstituent.canonicalName.search^4',
        'title.search^2',
        'keywords^2',
        'description',
        'searchText',
    ],
},
```

#### Collection Object Similarity

How one defines object similarity will vary from institution to institution. There are a number of approaches to querying Elasticsearch for similar documents, notably [`more_like_this`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-mlt-query.html).

This project uses a custom bool query of boosted should terms. [similarObjects.ts](./util/elasticsearch/search/similarObjects.ts) specifies which fields are used along with a boost value for each. The primary constituent (e.g. Artist, Maker, etc.) is given the most weight. These fields can be adjusted based on your institution's concept of object similarity. The current weights are:

- `primaryConstituent.canonicalName.search` - 6
- `dynasty` - 2
- `period` - 2
- `classification` - 1.5
- `medium` - 1
- `departments` - 1
- `exhibitions` - 1
- `primaryGeographicalLocation.name` - 1
